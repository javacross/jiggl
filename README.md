# Jiggl

Jiggl is a framework for developing 2D games that run on WebGL capable browsers
as well as in the JVM via LWJGL.

It is implemented in teh Java language, though it is designed to be usable with
JavaScript-based clients via the Google Web Toolkit Java to JavaScript
compiler.

It is currently extremely unfinished.
